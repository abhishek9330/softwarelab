**Python Web Application Framework for Data Management and Machine Learning Integration**

The aim of this project is to create a Python-based library similar to R's Shiny framework, enabling the rapid development of interactive web applications. This library will facilitate the following:

- A web application to upload data to a database.
- A web interface to extract data from the database, run pre-existing machine learning scripts, and store the results.
- A web app to retrieve and display these processed results to users.
- The library will be designed to be modular, user-friendly, and compatible with popular Python ML frameworks. This project will streamline workflows for data scientists, reducing the need for external tools.
